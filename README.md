# hand-written-recognition
we have used deep learning to recognition of digits
it's a basic project i have taken the dataset which inbuild dataset we have 
preprocess the data set and make it ready for the traning and used tenserflow and activation of softmax to train the data set 
and we have achieved nice accuracy as well
